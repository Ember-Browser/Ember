# Ember Browser

Ember is (will be) a new WebKit-based browser to challenge Mozilla's Gecko-based Firefox, and hopefully save the Free Web from dying with them.

## The reason we're doing this

We feel that Mozilla have lost touch with their community, that Mozilla's management have corrupted the image that once was Firefox, and that Firefox, as a browser, is dying because of it.
We chose WebKit because it's not only the most promising in our opinion, but because WebKit's beliefs of what a browser should do for the user align almost perfectly with ours.

## What we plan to do

Ember Browser should be a browser *for* the user, that doesn't get in the way of what the user wants or needs to do, and does so as effectively and efficiently as possible. All the while not collecting a single byte of our user's information.
We at Ember still believe that privacy and the Free Web is a possibility, even with the threat of a Chromium dominant web looming over us. We do not want to collect your information, just as we wouldn't want you collecting our information. We believe what you do is your business, and our business is helping you, not spying on you.

There are several key things that we plan to do to achieve this goal:

1: Make the browsing experience overall a decent one. It should be as performant as possible, all while keeping you, yes you, in complete control.

2: Support all necessary web standards and APIs, while leaving out those we believe infringe on the users' rights. If something is necessary, but not preferable (WebRTC, for example), we will make it completely optional, and toggleable on a per-site basis.

3: Make absolutely certain that the user is kept safe and private by randomizing the browser fingerprint as much as possible, preventing sites from being able to gauge information from referrals as much as we can, and even hide and/or randomize information regarding installed extensions, fonts, and clicked-links.

4: Support existing WebExtensions (likely Firefox's WebExtensions support because uBlock is epic), as well as providing an XUL-like interface of our own for more powerful browser extensions that would otherwise be impossible with WebExtensions alone.

5: Provide a rock-solid base for the browser that already has a ton of support on the web to ensure that as many sites as possible work as smoothly as possible.

In other words, don't put something out that we ourselves wouldn't use.

## Why choose Ember?

I know what a lot of people would probably think if given the decision:

"Why should I care about the free web? Google and Microsoft have all my information anyway."

There are many reason why you should support a Free Web, especially today.
First off, a direct response to that statement:

If you don't break away now, what stops them from continuing to collect information on you?

Secondly, you'd be helping others who may not have been tagged to prevent Google, Facebook, and other services like them from taking their information by giving them less power over us on a whole.

In this regard, it doesn't matter if you use Ember, Epiphany, Firefox, LibreWolf, Waterfox, Pale Moon, SeaMonkey, or Basilisk.
What makes Ember worth using is the fact that we're general people, just like you. We want to break away from the never-ending chain of spyware and digital rights abuse, but we want to still be able to do things on the web, like play WebGL and WebGPU games, use services like Odysee and YouTube, download games and software, talk to our friends on Telegram and Discord.

Gecko (Firefox, LibreWolf, Waterfox) doesn't run WebGL or WebGPU well at all.

Goanna (Pale Moon, Basilisk, SeaMonkey kind of) doesn't either, and they also have very poor support for modern web standards in general.

Firefox as of now is still perfectly usable as a browser, but we feel it could be much better, so we decided to do our own browser with WebKit. WebKit is fully capable of tackling anything and everything the modern web can throw at it, all the while not making any sacrifices on the privacy or user safety front.

We hope you find us one day once it's done, and we look forward to being your number one choice for privacy, performance, and everything in-between.
